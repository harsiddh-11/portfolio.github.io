### Predicting Credit Card Defaulter Using Naive-Bayes and XG boost

Flask web app which helps to identify whether the customer is going to default on the credit card payment. It takes a CSV file as input and contains personal information about the customer's previous loan payment history. Prediction done by implementing k-mean clustering and classifer ML algorithm to build effiecient model.
#### Key note:
* defining value of k using elbow plot and silhoutte score
* Performed gridsearchCV for tuning hyperparameter.
* Model evaulation done on the basis of roc_auc score and accuracy score.
#### Applied Skills

### NLP Model for Disaster Tweets

This model helps in predicting whether the tweet is a disaster or not using NLP tools and Tensorflow. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis,
Text cleansing and preprocessing and BERT Model. F1 Score is used to measure the prediction evaluation.
#### Key Takeaway:
* performing word embedding to simplify text preprocessing and improve vocabulary coverge.
* Visualizing unigram, bigram and trigram to in=dentify the similarities in pattern of train and test dataset.
